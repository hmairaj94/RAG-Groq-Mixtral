# End-to-End Advanced RAG Project using Open Source LLM Models such as Mixtral with Groq Inferencing Engine

## This project leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques with advanced, open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Mixtral, for efficient inferencing using the Groq hardware platform. The goal is to build a complete RAG system that can generate high-quality, contextually relevant responses by retrieving information from a knowledge base and enhancing it with language model generation.

## Project Objectives

- **Develop a RAG pipeline** to improve contextual response generation through information retrieval.
- **Implement Mixtral** with Groq’s inferencing engine to maximize efficiency and response times.
- **Use WebBasedLoader for data extraction**, with data sourced from various web-based knowledge repositories, including the LangSmith website.
- **Establish a streamlined, end-to-end RAG solution** for seamless data ingestion, pre-processing, retrieval, and inferencing.

## Key Features

1. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline**  
   - Integrates retrieval mechanisms with a generative model for response generation.
   - Utilizes WebBasedLoader to extract and structure information from web-based sources, specifically LangSmith.

2. **Data Extraction Using WebBasedLoader**  
   - Extracts knowledge from online sources, allowing quick access to recent data.
   - LangSmith website data used as a base for relevant information retrieval, ensuring high-quality and reliable responses.

3. **Groq Inferencing Engine Optimization**  
   - Uses the Groq inferencing engine to handle computationally intensive tasks, minimizing latency and improving throughput for large-scale data.
  
4. **Open-Source LLM Integration with Mixtral**  
   - Mistral’s architecture enables high-performance inferencing without excessive computational demand.
   - Configured for seamless integration within the RAG pipeline to enhance language understanding and generation.

5. **Scalability and Adaptability**  
   - Fully open-source, allowing customization for various deployment settings and hardware.
   - Compatible with Groq, making it ideal for performance-intensive environments.

## Architecture Overview

1. **Data Ingestion and Pre-Processing**  
   - WebBasedLoader extracts and preprocesses data from the LangSmith website, converting it into structured formats.
   - Implements text cleaning, tokenization, and embedding for effective data storage and retrieval.

2. **Document Embedding and Vector Store**  
   - Embeddings are generated for knowledge base documents and stored in a vector database for efficient retrieval.
   - Vector similarity searches enable quick, contextually relevant document access.

3. **Contextual Retrieval Module**  
   - Queries the vector database for relevant documents based on input prompts
   - Provides the top-N documents to enhance the context for LLM generation.

4. **LLM Generation with Mixtral**  
   - Processes retrieved context along with input query, leveraging Mixtral for generating accurate and relevant responses.
  
5. **Inferencing via Groq Engine**  
   - Runs the inferencing pipeline on Groq hardware, maximizing response time and reducing computational costs.
